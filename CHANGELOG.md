# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0 (2025-11-21)

- Introduced the Squid 6.14 multi-stage Debian Bookworm build, documenting its features, configuration guidance, and licensing across README, SPECIFICATION, AGENTS, and DockerHub.
- Added an upstream healthcheck (`squidclient mgr:info`), CONTRIBUTING guide, and GPL-3.0-or-later license reference so the image is documented and ready for publication.
